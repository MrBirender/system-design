Great! You're starting your **System Design** journey — this is one of the most important and challenging skills for any backend developer, software engineer, or architect. Let's lay a **clear roadmap**, starting from **what it is**, to **all the key concepts** you need to master.

---

## 🧠 What Is System Design?

**System Design** is the process of **designing the architecture of a software system** to meet specific functional and non-functional requirements (like performance, scalability, security, etc.).

Imagine you’re asked to design something like:

* WhatsApp
* Zomato
* Netflix
* Uber
* A real-time chat app
* A file-sharing platform (like Google Drive)

System design teaches you **how to think, plan, and build** these large-scale systems.

---

## 🚀 Why It's Important

* **Interviews:** It's a core part of FAANG/Big Tech interviews.
* **Scalability:** You learn to build systems that serve **millions or billions of users**.
* **Performance:** Make software **faster, fault-tolerant, and efficient**.
* **Collaboration:** Architects and seniors think at system design level, not just code.

---

## 📘 Key Concepts You Need to Learn

Let’s break this into **7 core sections**:

---

### ✅ 1. **Fundamentals**

* What is system design?
* Types of system design:

  * **High-Level Design (HLD)** – Components, interactions, architecture.
  * **Low-Level Design (LLD)** – Classes, methods, internal logic.

---

### ✅ 2. **Building Blocks**

Learn the core components every system uses:

| Concept                 | Description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Client-Server Model** | Browser, app ↔️ server                           |
| **DNS**                 | Resolves domain names to IPs (like we discussed) |
| **Load Balancer**       | Distributes traffic across servers               |
| **Web Server**          | Handles HTTP requests                            |
| **Application Server**  | Runs your backend logic (e.g., Node.js, Django)  |
| **Database**            | Stores and retrieves structured data             |
| **Cache**               | In-memory speed boost (Redis, Memcached)         |
| **CDN**                 | Content delivery network — for static content    |
| **Queue**               | Asynchronous tasks (RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS)        |
| **Storage Systems**     | S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc. for files         |

---

### ✅ 3. **Design Principles**

* Scalability (Horizontal vs Vertical)
* Availability (HA, Failover, Replication)
* Reliability (RAID, Backups)
* Consistency (CAP Theorem, Eventual vs Strong)
* Latency vs Throughput
* Idempotency
* Stateless vs Stateful

---

### ✅ 4. **Database Design**

* Relational (SQL) vs NoSQL (Document, Key-Value, Column, Graph)
* Sharding, Partitioning, Replication
* Indexing, Query Optimization
* ACID vs BASE
* Joins vs Denormalization
* Data modeling

---

### ✅ 5. **Scaling Systems**

* Vertical vs Horizontal scaling
* Caching strategies (Write-through, Write-around, etc.)
* Database sharding
* CDN usage
* Rate Limiting
* Load balancing strategies (Round Robin, IP Hashing)
* Session management

---

### ✅ 6. **Advanced Topics**

* Microservices vs Monolith
* API Gateways
* Event-Driven Architecture
* WebSockets & Long Polling (for real-time systems)
* Message Queues & Streams
* Distributed Systems
* Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting
* Security: Auth, OAuth, HTTPS, Encryption, DDoS

---

### ✅ 7. **System Design Case Studies (Projects)**

You’ll put everything together to design systems like:

| System            | Focus Area                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **URL Shortener** | Hashing, DB, Redirection, cache         |
| **Instagram**     | Image storage, feed generation, scaling |
| **WhatsApp**      | Real-time, message delivery guarantees  |
| **Netflix**       | Video streaming, CDN, recommendation    |
| **Uber**          | Real-time location tracking, matching   |
| **Amazon**        | Product catalog, payments, orders       |
| **Twitter Feed**  | Fan-out, caching, timelines             |
